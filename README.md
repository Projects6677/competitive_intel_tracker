🧠 Competitive Intelligence Tracker for Startups

AI Agent Hackathon 2025 Project — Empowering startups with actionable, real-time competitive intelligence.

🚀 Overview

Startups face a constant challenge: competitors launch new features, update pricing, and run marketing campaigns at lightning speed. Keeping track manually is nearly impossible and can lead to missed opportunities or strategic missteps.

The Competitive Intelligence Tracker solves this problem by:

Monitoring competitor websites, blogs, social media, and press releases

Detecting meaningful changes automatically

Summarizing insights via AI into actionable intelligence

Delivering alerts through Slack, Telegram, and Streamlit dashboard

This ensures startup teams are proactive, not reactive, making smarter decisions faster.

🧩 Core Features

🌐 Smart Monitoring: Real-time scraping of competitor websites, blogs, Twitter, Reddit, and news portals.

🤖 AI-Powered Summarization: Uses NLP and Gemini API to convert raw updates into structured intelligence.

💬 Multi-Channel Notifications: Slack and Telegram alerts ensure your team sees critical updates instantly.

📊 Interactive Dashboard: Streamlit interface visualizes trends, competitor movements, and actionable insights.

🗄️ Persistent Storage: SQLite database stores historical snapshots and AI-analyzed summaries.
